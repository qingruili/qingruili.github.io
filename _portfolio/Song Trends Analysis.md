Applied Hugging Face models to analyze emotions in song lyrics across 25+ languages, uncovering patterns in sentiment, language, and their influence on global music trends. Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to showcase insights on how economic trends, happiness, and sentiment impact song popularity across countries and years.
