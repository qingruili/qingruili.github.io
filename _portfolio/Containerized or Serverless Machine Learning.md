Our project explores two deployment strategies - containerized and serverless - for serving a pre-trained LightGBM model for email spam detection on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
The objective is to implement both approaches using consistent model logic and cloud resources, and to evaluate their performance through a series of experiments.
